# Ecommerce Spending Prediction

This project analyzes an ecommerce dataset to understand customer behavior and predict yearly spending using Linear Regression.

## Project Structure
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insights into customer activity on app, website, and membership.
- **Data Cleaning:** Checking missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Feature Selection:** Key numerical features affecting spending.
- **Model Training:** Linear Regression with scikit-learn.
- **Evaluation:** Metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².
- **Residual Analysis:** Distribution, Q-Q plot, and comparison between actual and predicted values.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn, scipy

## Open in Google Colab
